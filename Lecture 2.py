# ***1- IF and ELSE***
# 

# In programming, we often ask yes or no questions, and decide to do 
# something based on the answer.

# ***1.1 IF Statements***

# In[5]:

if age > 20:
    Print ('you are too good!')


# ***Python block***
# 
# A block is the structure of code to separate part of the code from another part of the code. 
# 
# When you change the indentation, youâ€™re generally creating new blocks.

# In[4]:

# ***1.2 Else Statement***

# In[6]:

# ***3- Code and Functions Modules***
# 

# 
# ***A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. 
# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. 
# A function can return data as a result. Creating a Function In Python a function is defined using the def keyword****

# In[18]:


def my_function():
     print("Hello from a function")


# In[19]:


def my_function():
      print("Hello from a function")

my_function()


# In[34]:


def my_function(fname, lname):
      print(fname + " " + lname)

my_function("Emil", "rana")


# In[21]:


## Using return
def variable_test ():
    first_variable = 10
    second_variable = 20

def variable_test2():
    first_variable = 10
    second_variable = 20
    return first_variable * second_variable * another_variable
print(variable_test2())


# ***Module***
# 
# A module can define functions, classes, and variables. 
# A module can also include runnable code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.
# It also makes the code logically organized.

# In[25]:


def add(x, y):
    return (x+y)
 
def subtract(x, y):
    return (x-y)


# In[28]:

    print('What is Migraine? A headache!')
else:
    print('Very Sad')


# ***5- Python Classes and Objects***
# 

# 
# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.Objects are a way of organizing code in a program and breaking things 
# down to make it easier to think about complex ideas.
# 
# 

# In[31]:


## Create a class
class MyClass:
      x = 5


# In[33]:


## Create an Object
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)


# In[35]:


class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Uzair", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
